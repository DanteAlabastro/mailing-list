>A nice little email generator to fill in names and addresses.

Use this to quickly generate links to emails templates filled
out with the names and email addresses from your Address Book.

The name is inserted to the body of the email and the appropriate address is set.

By clicking the links from your browser, a pre-populated email will appear
for you to review and send.

**This was created using Google Chrome as the browser. I have not tested it with other browsers.**

### Requirements:
1. You must be signed into your email service.
2. You must have Service Handlers enabled.
3. Allow your email provider to open email links.
